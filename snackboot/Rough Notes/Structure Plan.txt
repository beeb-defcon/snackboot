In general the whole thing should just be a big loop.
Consider Defcon 5 and 4 as a setup phase.
Then Defcon 3 and onward just do Update -> Strategize -> Execute.
Execute is when we work on long tasks, because the action of turning a bomber shouldn't really be atomic, it's embarrassingly parallel.
Update is getting new current information on fleets and fighters and such - otherwise we would be polling the world too often.
Strategize is updating the internal data structures to find roles for everything. In addition to fleets, we should have "bombing runs" and "fighter escorts". Every bomber should belong to a battleship escort, fighter escort, or bombing run. Every bombing run has 

So the main function, after defcon 3, calls this one big function which pauses itself frequently.
